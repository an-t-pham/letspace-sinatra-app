##Checklist

### PART 1 - Project Setup: Corneal, MVC, ActiveRecord

**BEFORE YOU CODE**
- [x] 1. Check project requirements in spec.md
- [x] 2. Ideate! What do you want to build?
     - choose a domain you're familiar with!
     - choose a domain you care about
- [x] 3. Wireframing & User Stories
     - Write down your models, their attributes, and their associations
     - "As a user, I can ... "
     - "A user should be able to ... "
     - What does your app do?
- [x] 4. Design your MVP = 'Minimum Viable Product' vs. what are my 'stretch goals'
     - Stretch goals - bonus features you want but don't need

**NOW WE CODE (BUT JUST OUR MODELS - NO CONTROLLERS OR VIEWS)**

- [x] 5. Generate new project using corneal gem
- [x] 6. Create github repo
- [x] 7. Build your models
     - Migrations
     - Model classes
     - Associations
- [] 8. Test your models and associations in the console
     - Create some seed data
     - Adjust migrations as needed


### PART 2

**NOW, CONSIDER CONTROLLERS AND VIEWS**

- [] 9. Start with your ApplicationController helpers - '#logged_in?' and '#current_user'
     - add your login/signup/signout routes  
- [] 10. Build out controller routes for other models (add a controller for each model)
- [] 11. Build views and controller actions based on the flow of your app, one step at a time, testing as you go!
